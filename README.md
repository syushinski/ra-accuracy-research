I used a lot of the same code from https://github.com/obastani/dtextract.
Specifically, python/dtextract/examples/runCsv.py. Along with the given example files, I made more
to go with the extra datasets. To run all of the example files you can run all.py, by simply doing

      $ cd python
      $ python -m dtextract.examples.all

You can also modify the code in runCsv to make it run CORELS and expertsys, as
long as you have expertsys in the same folder, and as long as you have CORElS installed via pip.
